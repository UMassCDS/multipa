# multipa
MultIPA is yet another automatic speech transcription model into phonetic IPA.
The idea is that, if we train a multilingual speech-to-IPA model with enough amount of good phoneme representations, the model's output will be approximated to phonetic transcriptions.

## Available training languages
At this moment, we have the following languages incorporated available in the training data:
- English
- Finnish
- Hungarian
- Japanese
- Maltese
- Modern Greek
- Polish
- Tamil

Note that English was added after the INTERSPEECH 2023 paper was submitted.
We aim to include more languages to take into account linguistic diversity.
